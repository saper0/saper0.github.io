## Graph Learning

ToDo: lecture machine learning with graphs

Matthias Fey, the creator of PyTorch Geometric (PyG) gave a very cool presentation of PyG 2.0 at the [Graph Representation Learning Reading Group](https://grlmila.github.io/) at Mila - Quebec AI Institue. Direct link to the talk [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJjL_rzFQx5m53ZpJ5tYozZdCohnagaK/view).

## Graph Theory

## Probability Theory

#### Basic Probability Theory
*by Robert B. Ash*

Use: Second introduction to probability theory. Introduces wordings of measure theory but does not built on it. Proofs basic combinatoric formulars in chapter 1.4 and Stirling's Formula in 1.8. Maybe interesting to read the Characteristic Functions Chapter, which also includes a proof of the central limit theorem.

## Philosophy & Ethics

#### Philosophy of Technology
*by Maarten Frannsen, Gert-Jan Lokhorst and Ibo van de Poel*

Used in related a TU Munich course as textbook and online in [The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/technology/)
