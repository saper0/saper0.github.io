<h2 id="graph-learning">Graph Learning</h2>

<p>ToDo: lecture machine learning with graphs</p>

<p>Matthias Fey, the creator of PyTorch Geometric (PyG) gave a very cool presentation of PyG 2.0 at the <a href="https://grlmila.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Graph Representation Learning Reading Group</a> at Mila - Quebec AI Institue. Direct link to the talk <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJjL_rzFQx5m53ZpJ5tYozZdCohnagaK/view" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="graph-theory">Graph Theory</h2>

<h2 id="probability-theory">Probability Theory</h2>

<h4 id="basic-probability-theory">Basic Probability Theory</h4>
<p><em>by Robert B. Ash</em></p>

<p>Use: Second introduction to probability theory. Introduces wordings of measure theory but does not built on it. Proofs basic combinatoric formulars in chapter 1.4 and Stirling’s Formula in 1.8. Maybe interesting to read the Characteristic Functions Chapter, which also includes a proof of the central limit theorem.</p>

<h2 id="philosophy--ethics">Philosophy &amp; Ethics</h2>

<h4 id="philosophy-of-technology">Philosophy of Technology</h4>
<p><em>by Maarten Frannsen, Gert-Jan Lokhorst and Ibo van de Poel</em></p>

<p>Used in related a TU Munich course as textbook and online in <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/technology/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a></p>
