	abstract = "{Protein orthologous group databases are powerful tools for evolutionary analysis, functional annotation or metabolic pathway modeling across lineages. Sequences are typically assigned to orthologous groups with alignment-based methods, such as profile hidden Markov models, which have become a computational bottleneck.We present DeepNOG, an extremely fast and accurate, alignment-free orthology assignment method based on deep convolutional networks. We compare DeepNOG against state-of-the-art alignment-based (HMMER, DIAMOND) and alignment-free methods (DeepFam) on two orthology databases (COG, eggNOG 5). DeepNOG can be scaled to large orthology databases like eggNOG, for which it outperforms DeepFam in terms of precision and recall by large margins. While alignment-based methods still provide the most accurate assignments among the investigated methods, computing time of DeepNOG is an order of magnitude lower on CPUs. Optional GPU usage further increases throughput massively. A command-line tool enables rapid adoption by users.Source code and packages are freely available at https://github.com/univieCUBE/deepnog.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new mathematical model for tactical transportation planning in a horizontal collaboration defined by warehouse sharing and the joint organization of transport. The model features intermodal transport, handling and storage capacities, diverse products and realistic tariff structures with volume discounts. Furthermore, it allows for sustainable planning by associating estimated CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions to each logistic operation and then either optimize for transportation costs, emissions or both objectives. Subsequently, we derive a mixed-integer formulation for exact solution approaches and a hybrid heuristic to solve large-scale instances. The hybrid heuristic is composed of a slope scaling matheuristic we generalized to non-negative integer variables and a second local search based refinement step, which reroutes flow of multiple products at once along lowest-cost paths in the network. Results obtained from simulating collaboration in the Danube Region using the regional available transportation infrastructure including railway and shipping networks reveal significant saving potentials in both costs and CO2e emissions. Cost minimizing solutions always lead to reductions of the carbon footprint. However, minimizing for emissions can significantly further this reduction but requires a minimum size of the collaboration to operate cost-efficiently.}
