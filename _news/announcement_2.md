I have been co-author of my first publication :sparkles: :smile:. It is about a new <br>
deep learning architecture for protein similarity search, check it out [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1051). <br>
We have also released the software on [GitHub](https://github.com/univieCUBE/deepnog).
