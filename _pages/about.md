I am a machine learning researcher having broad interests spanning from theoretical machine learning over learning on graphs to optimization. 
>>>>>>> d447bc0 (Updated about-me.)

I am a researcher on reliable machine learning and focus on robust and privacy-preserving learning on graphs. I am doing my PhD at TU Munich under the supervision of [Prof. GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/) in the [DAML](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/startseite/) research group. Furthermore, I am also interested in theoretical machine learning and have experience in combinatorial optimization.
