Hello, welcome to my corner of the web! 

I am a researcher on reliable machine learning and focus on robust and privacy-preserving learning on graphs. I am doing my PhD at TU Munich under the supervision of [Prof. GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/) in the [DAML](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/startseite/) research group. Furthermore, I am also interested in theoretical machine learning and have experience in combinatorial optimization. 

If you want to contact me, best drop me an e-mail: *gosch . lukas [at] gmail.com*. Scroll down to find my other social media appearances.
